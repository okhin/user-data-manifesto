# user data manifesto

defining basic rights for people to control their own data in the
internet age

1. Control of user data access

	Data created by user should be kept under their sole control. Only
	the user is able to publish or not some data. And the only way to
	achieve this goal is to use strong cryptographic routines for
	storing those data.

2. Know where the data is stored

	Users should know what entities can access their personnal data,
	and what laws applies to it. With so much virtualisation and
	decentralisation, it might be hard to acheive, so each user should
	keep the data they want to publish on a machine they can control.

3. Right to leave a platform

	Users' data can't be locked in one platform. They must be able to
	move to a different platform, and to recover all the private data
	they have stored in an machineanduser understandable format.

    For this, open standards for formats and protocoles are
    a necessity, and to warranty the interoperability only free
	software should be used server side.

4. Protect the data 

	User's data are part of the user and it must be protected from
	seizure and spying. Federating the data and encryption must be
	allowed to grant backup insuranceand protection from
	eavesdropping.
